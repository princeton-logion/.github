# Princeton Logion Project

The Princeton Logion Project explores the potential role of machine learning in advancing philology for the restoration and elucidation of premodern Greek texts. The project specifically produces [ancient-language models](https://huggingface.co/princeton-logion) and a [no-code application](https://github.com/princeton-logion/logion-app) to assist classics scholars in various philological tasks, such as text restoration, error detection, and translation. This software is not designed to provide out-of-the-box solutions to philological problems but rather concrete suggestions and general inspiration. Indeed, logion (λόγιον) means ‘oracle’ in ancient Greek. We chose this name to emphasize that machine-generated results require human interpretation. 

We're using our software to edit and restore texts by the Byzantine author Michael Psellos, Aristotle, and other major Greek authors. In the future, we intend to adapt our software to serve other languages. We hope Logion empowers classical philologists by leveraging recent advances in AI to help preserve and illuminate the global archive of ancient texts.
